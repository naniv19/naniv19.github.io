                        Final Fantasy XIV[b] was a 2010 massively 
                        multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) 
                        for Windows, developed and published by 
                        Square Enix. It was the original version of 
                        the fourteenth entry in the main Final 
                        Fantasy series and the second MMORPG in 
                        the series after Final Fantasy XI. Set in 
                        the fantasy realm of Eorzea, players took control 
                        of a customized avatar as they explored the 
                        land and were caught up in both an invasion by 
                        the hostile Garlean Empire and the threat of the 
                        primals, the deities of the land's beastmen tribes. 
                        Eventually, they were embroiled in a plot by a 
                        Garlean Legatus to destroy the primals by bringing 
                        one of the planet's moons down on Eorzea.

                        Final Fantasy XIV had been in development 
                        since 2005 under the codename "Rapture", 
                        and was announced in 2009 for Windows and the 
                        PlayStation 3 video game console. It ran on 
                        Square Enix's Crystal Tools middleware engine, 
                        which was adjusted to suit the game's 
                        specifications. During development, the team 
                        carried over multiple aesthetic elements from 
                        Final Fantasy XI while attempting to create 
                        something that stood on its own. Due to several 
                        factors, the development was beset by 
                        problems that would later have drastic 
                        effects on the game. Attempts to bring the 
                        game to Xbox 360 consoles fell through due 
                        to disagreements with Microsoft about the 
                        use of Xbox Live.

                    <p>
                        After its alpha test and a delayed beta test, 
                        the game went live on September 30, 2010, 
                        remaining active until its servers were closed 
                        on November 11, 2012. At launch, the game 
                        was met with a negative response: while the 
                        graphics and music were praised, other 
                        aspects were unanimously panned, including the 
                        gameplay, interface, and the general 
                        impression of the game being unfinished. 
                        Critic and fan backlash caused Square Enix 
                        to suspend subscription fees, indefinitely 
                        postpone the PlayStation 3 version, and 
                        replace the development team leadership, with 
                        Naoki Yoshida brought in as producer and 
                        director. Yoshida decided to make marginal 
                        improvements before the game's shutdown, 
                        ultimately replacing it with a new version 
                        initially subtitled A Realm Reborn, which met 
                        with a favorable reception upon its release.

                        Final Fantasy XIV was a massively multiplayer 
                        online role-playing game (MMORPG) in which 
                        the player controlled a customized Adventurer 
                        avatar from one of the five playable races. 
                        Each race had two tribes, and all but two 
                        allowed for the selection of male or female 
                        characters. The avatar could have their eye and 
                        hair color, facial features, and skin tone 
                        customized, and features such as birthmarks 
                        and scars were able to be added. Their chosen 
                        tribe, along with their chosen patron deity, 
                        affected their stats and elemental attributes.[1]
                        The game's opening varied depending on which 
                        starting location was chosen.[2] Two different 
                        types of quests were available for players: 
                        story quests, which were unlocked as characters 
                        accumulated experience points (EXP) and raised 
                        their experience level while unlocking new 
                        abilities, and Levequests (leves), side quests 
                        accessed through the Adventurers' Guilds. 
                        Leves were broken down into multiple types, 
                        focusing on gathering or combat. Levequests 
                        were associated with particular non-playable 
                        characters (NPCs). As the player completed 
                        leves, they gained favor with three different 
                        factions and unlocked new abilities, 
                        with rewards only coming from the NPCs within 
                        the factions who issued the quest. Gaining 
                        favor also unlocked a new type of level 
                        called Faction leves, which depleted a character's 
                        favor when completed.[1][2][3]

                    <p>
                        Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based 
                        gameplay is forefront at all times, the gameplay 
                        in XIV was adjusted so that players could go 
                        for longer periods without joining a party.[4] 
                        There was no auto-attack option, with each 
                        action needing a manual input while an enemy 
                        was targeted. Each action used up a stamina 
                        bar.[3] Through defeating monsters, crafting 
                        items, and completing quests, players 
                        accumulated EXP which, when a certain threshold 
                        was reached, automatically incremented the 
                        player's level. The player's level affected 
                        attributes such as HP (health/hit points), 
                        MP (magic/mana points), and the number of 
                        abilities available to them.[5]

                        The story of Final Fantasy XIV takes place in a 
                        high fantasy setting. The main location is Eorzea, 
                        a geopolitical region on the larger planet 
                        Hydaelyn: this contrasts Final Fantasy XI which 
                        uses one name to refer to the entire world 
                        and its regions.[7] Eorzea is broken up into 
                        three main powers: the forest nation of 
                        Gridania; the desert-based Ul'dah sultanate; 
                        and the thalassocracy of Limsa Lominsa, 
                        Eorzea's dominant maritime power.[8][9] Other 
                        important locations include the scholarly 
                        city-state of Sharlayan and the Garlean Empire, 
                        a hostile northern power with highly 
                        developed technology. Five years prior to the 
                        start of the game, the Garlean Empire 
                        invaded the land of Ala Mhigo, but was prevented 
                        from conquering Eorzea by the attacks of the 
                        ancient dragon Midgardsormr and his dragon 
                        hordes. In response to the Empire's threat, 
                        the three nations of Eorzea reformed the G
                        rand Companies, comprehensive centers of command 
                        which combine the cities' military and 
                        economic assets. The Grand Companies attracted 
                        people from all walks of life, who take up the 
                        mantle of Adventurers.[10]

                    <h4 id="plot">Plot</h4>
                    <p>
                        Beginning in one of Eorzea's three main states, 
                        the player character awakens to the Echo, a power 
                        granting them the ability to see the past.[3] 
                        The Adventurers are initially involved in both 
                        conflicts within the nations provoked by the 
                        Garlean presence, led by the Garlean Legatus 
                        Gaius van Baelsar, and the beastmen's attempts 
                        to hoard crystals and summon their primals. 
                        Eventually, a greater threat is brought to 
                        the attention of the nations by the Sharlayan 
                        scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean 
                        Legatus named Nael van Darnus is using arcane 
                        magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the 
                        planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge 
                        the beastmen and primals whom the Garleans 
                        hate as violent pagans. With the aid of Garlean 
                        defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers 
                        discover that Nael has set up a beacon for 
                        summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of 
                        castrum Novum. While each nation makes 
                        individual attempts to storm the fortress,
                        they are repelled. Faced with this, their 
                        leaders form a pact and unite the nations 
                        under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.[10]

                        Planning for Final Fantasy XIV began in 2005, 
                        four years prior to its official announcement. 
                        At the time, it was codenamed "Rapture" 
                        (ラプチャー, Rapuchā). While it had been decided 
                        within the company that MMORPGs would be 
                        mainline entries rather than spin-offs, 
                        the team was worried that the final product 
                        would be too radical for the main numbered 
                        series.[7] The main staff included multiple 
                        developers who had worked on previous 
                        entries in the Final Fantasy series: 
                        producer Hiromichi Tanaka had acted as the 
                        original producer for Final Fantasy XI 
                        and been involved in multiple early Final 
                        Fantasy games, director Nobuaki Komoto 
                        was a director for XI and had been among 
                        the staff of Final Fantasy IX, writer 
                        Yaeko Sato had been the main scenario writer 
                        for XI, and Akihiko Yoshida had previously 
                        also been art director for Vagrant Story 
                        and Final Fantasy XII. The game's logo and 
                        some other artwork was designed by 
                        Yoshitaka Amano.[5][7]

                    <p>
                        The music for Final Fantasy XIV was composed by 
                        Nobuo Uematsu, a regular contributor to the music 
                        of the Final Fantasy series.[5] Originally 
                        contracted to create the ending theme for XIII, 
                        Uematsu accepted the request by the XIV team to 
                        work on the game, leaving XIII's theme song to 
                        be composed by Masashi Hamauzu.[24] Having only 
                        contributed a few tunes to Final Fantasy XI, XIV 
                        was Uematsu's first full-time work on an MMORPG. 
                        Despite this, he was treated as he would be on any 
                        other project and had considerable creative freedom 
                        as the team's vision for the game had not been 
                        finalized. For the battle themes, he used a mix 
                        of orchestral and rock pieces. He worked on XIV 
                        at the same time as working on The Last Story, a 
                        video game from original Final Fantasy creator 
                        ironobu Sakaguchi.[25][26] During the time XIV was 
                        active after the initial release, other composers 
                        including Masayoshi Soken, Naoshi Mizuta, 
                        Tsuyoshi Sekito and Ryo Yamazaki contributed to 
                        the score.[27] Soken acted as the game's sound 
                        director and would take over as the main composer 
                        for its relaunch.[28] The game's theme song, 
                        "Answers", was composed by Uematsu and sung by 
                        Susan Calloway, who was specially chosen by 
                        Uematsu after hearing her rendition of previous 
                        Final Fantasy theme songs.[29]

                        XIV was first hinted at the 2005 Electronic 
                        Entertainment Expo (E3) when Square Enix 
                        announced that they were developing a new MMORPG, 
                        showing it off using a tech demo. The demo 
                        included aesthetic elements similar to XI, 
                        such as races from Vana'diel.[33] In 2006, 
                        rumors emerged that Square Enix was developing 
                        a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XI, but 
                        further details remained unknown.[34] During 
                        the next few years, contradictory reports 
                        were issued as to what platforms the game 
                        was being developed for: the platforms listed 
                        varied from the game being an Xbox 360 
                        exclusive, to being for PlayStation platforms, 
                        to being for PlayStation 3 (PS3), Windows, 
                        and Xbox 360 platforms.[33][35][36] XIV was 
                        officially announced at E3 2009 for PS3, 
                        then for Windows.[37] After its official reveal 
                        for those platforms, it was stated that a 
                        port to Microsoft hardware was under consideration.
                        [38] Despite negotiation with Microsoft 
                        concerning an Xbox 360 version of the game, 
                        the two companies were unable to agree upon 
                        the use of Xbox Live, as Square Enix wanted 
                        a shared server across all platforms and 
                        Microsoft would not give them the full access 
                        necessary to implement this. Because of 
                        this disagreement and the consequent extra 
                        manpower needed to develop a version 
                        separate from the other two platforms, 
                        development on the Xbox 360 version was 
                        stopped.[39]
