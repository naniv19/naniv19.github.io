        <p>
            Bibimbap is one of my favorite Korean dishes, combining so many 
            flavors and textures into one delicious bowl. With tender 
            marinated bulgogi, a variety of seasoned vegetables, and a spicy 
            gochujang sauce, each bite is a delightful mix of savory, sweet, 
            and spicy. Topped with a fried egg and served over sizzling 
            jasmine rice, this dish is the definition of COMFORT!

        <h3 id="section2">PREPARING THE BULGOGI</h3>
        <p>
            Bulgogi, or marinated beef, is the star of this dish! Start by 
            thinly slicing boneless ribeye steak and marinating it in a 
            mixture of soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame oil, minced garlic, 
            ginger paste, chili powder, red pepper flakes, black pepper, olive 
            oil, and a splash of rice vinegar. Let the beef soak up all 
            these wonderful flavors for at least 30 minutes, but if you have 
            more time, letting it marinate longer will make it even more 
            delicious. This is optional but adds so much flavor – thinly 
            slice yellow onions and add them to the marinade with the beef. 
            Once marinated, cook the beef in a hot skillet over very high 
            heat until it’s fully cooked and caramelized. It cooks very fast 
            since the meat is really thin. The result is tender, flavorful 
            beef that adds a savory depth to your bibimbap.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some stores sell already prepared thinly shaved ribeye like the 
            kind used to make Philly cheesteaks. You can also find it 
            sometimes at an Asian supermarket like H-Mart. If you are thinly 
            slicing it yourself, popping the steak in the freezer for an 
            hour before will help firm it up a bit to make it easier to cut.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tips:</b> For the best texture, make sure your steak slices 
            are as thin as possible. Partially freezing the steak before 
            slicing can make this easier. If you don’t want to thinly slice 
            steak yourself, you can buy shaved steak from the store. 
            They sell it at Trader Joe’s and a lot of supermarkets – it’s 
            the same meat used to make Philly Cheesesteaks. You can also find 
            thinly shaved steak at the Korean store H-Mart.
        </p>
        <h3 id="section3">COOKING THE VEGGIES</h3>
        <p>
            The variety of vegetables in bibimbap not only adds nutrition but 
            also a beautiful array of colors and textures. The veggies are 
            what make this dish feel like one big warm hug. Now this can get 
            a bit overwhelming because there are so many veggies and each is 
            prepared its own way. So feel free to tweak this part of the 
            process whether it’s using less veggies or switching up which kind 
            you use!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>MUSHROOMS:</b> For the mushrooms, sauté chopped shiitake 
            mushrooms in butter with a sprinkle of salt and pepper until 
            they’re tender over medium heat. You can use any kind of mushrooms 
            you love like portobello, white, or even enoki!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>CARROTS:</b> For the carrots, julienne them and sauté in a 
            bit of water and sesame oil with a pinch of salt until they 
            soften. I just buy shredded carrots in a bag from the store and 
            use that!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>SPINACH:</b> Add the spinach to a pan over low heat, season 
            with salt, and cover until spinach is softened and wilted.
        </p>   
        <p>
            <b>CUCUMBERS:</b> For a tangy crunch, mix diced cucumbers with 
            chili paste, sugar, rice vinegar, hot water, and a pinch of salt, 
            letting it sit for a few minutes to pickle quickly.
        </p>  
        <p>
            <b>BEAN SPROUTS:</b> Finally, blanch the bean sprouts in boiling 
            water and drain them well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tips:</b> You can prepare the veggies ahead of time and store 
            them in separate containers in the fridge. This makes assembling 
            the bibimbap much quicker.
        </p>
        <h3 id="section4">MAKING THE GOCHUJANG SAUCE</h3>
        <p>
            The gochujang sauce is the heart of bibimbap. Combine gochujang 
            paste with sesame oil, low-sodium soy sauce, a touch of white 
            sugar, water, and a dollop of Kewpie mayo. Adjust the ingredients 
            to your taste. You can also opt for mild gochujang or hot 
            gochujang paste. This sauce ties all the ingredients together with 
            its rich, spicy flavor.
        </p>
        <h3 id="section5">ASSEMBLING THE BIBIMBAP</h3>
        <p>
            Start with a base of cooked jasmine rice in a bowl. Arrange the 
            bulgogi, mushrooms, carrots, spinach, cucumbers, and bean sprouts 
            on top of the rice. Drizzle generously with the gochujang sauce. 
            Top everything with a fried egg and a sprinkle of chopped green 
            onions. Mix everything together before eating to enjoy all the 
            flavors and textures in each bite.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tips:</b> For an extra special touch, use a hot stone pot 
            (dolsot) to assemble your bibimbap. The pot gives the rice a crispy 
            bottom and keeps everything warm. Just put the hot stone pot in 
            a preheated oven for 30 minutes to get it nice hot. If you have 
            an open flame stove, even better to get the dolsot nice and hot on 
            there. Once hot, coat it in sesame oil and add the rice. Let it 
            sizzle and get nice and crispy before adding all the toppings. 
            See the next section for more details on this!
        </p>
        <h3 id="section6">TRADITIONAL HOT STONE POT BIBIMBAP</h3>
        <p>
            To make bibimbap the traditional way, you’ll need a hot stone pot.
            Heat the pot on the stove until it’s very hot, then add a bit of 
            sesame oil to the bottom. Quickly add the cooked jasmine rice, 
            pressing it down slightly. Arrange the bulgogi, vegetables, and 
            gochujang sauce on top, just like before. Let the pot sit on the 
            heat until you hear the rice crackling. The result is a bibimbap 
            with a deliciously crispy rice bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tips:</b> Be careful when handling the hot stone pot; it 
            gets very hot. Use oven mitts to protect your hands.
        </p>
        <h3 id="section7">VARIATIONS TO TRY</h3>
        <p>
            Bibimbap is incredibly versatile, and there are many variations 
            you can try. For a vegetarian version, simply skip the bulgogi 
            and add more veggies or some tofu marinated in soy sauce, sesame 
            oil, and garlic. If you prefer chicken, marinate thinly sliced 
            chicken breast or thigh in the same marinade as the bulgogi and 
            cook it until it’s tender and caramelized. You can also 
            experiment with different vegetables, such as bell peppers, 
            zucchini, or kale, to add your personal touch to the dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Tips:</b> Use whatever vegetables you have on hand to make 
            your bibimbap unique. The key is to balance the flavors and 
            textures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bibimbap is not only a feast for the eyes but also a delight 
            for the palate. With its harmonious blend of flavors and textures, 
            it’s a dish that’s sure to satisfy. Whether you stick to the 
            traditional recipe or try out some variations, making bibimbap 
            at home is a rewarding experience that brings a taste of Korea 
            to your kitchen. Enjoy!
